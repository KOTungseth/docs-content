[[deprecations-november-18-2024]]
=== Deprecation
*Remove `metrics:allowCheckingForFailedShards` Advanced Setting*

The `metrics:allowCheckingForFailedShards` Advanced Setting in TSVB has been removed. This change eliminates the ability to suppress warnings about failed shards in TSVB visualizations. Users are encouraged to address shard issues directly rather than relying on suppression mechanisms. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}197227[#197227]).

Impact:

* TSVB will no longer suppress warnings for failed shards in visualizations.
* You may encounter shard-related warnings more prominently when misconfigurations or data inconsistencies arise.

To test and adjust for this deprecation:

1. Create a TSVB visualization, such as one using the *Kibana Ecommerce* data view, and include a field (e.g., `day_of_week_i``).
2. Modify the data view pattern to match multiple indices (e.g., change `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce` to `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce`).
3. Add an index with mismatched mappings via the Dev Console:
+
POST /kibana_sample_data_ecommerce_2/_doc  
{  
  "order_date": "2024-10-22",  
  "day_of_week_i": "Hello"  
}  
4. Refresh your TSVB visualization and observe shard warnings for misconfigured or inconsistent data.
