Get started with Elasticsearch in a few steps.
Ingest, search, and explore some sample data after setting up your project:

1. [Set up project](#set-up-project)
2. [Ingest](#ingest)
3. [Search](#search)
4. [Explore](#explore)

## Set up your project

A project allows you to use one of the Elastic solutions -- Elasticsearch Serverless, Observability, Security -- and run them in an autoscaled and fully-managed environment, where you don't have to manage the underlying Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana instances.

### Create your project

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/).

1. Log in to your Elastic Cloud account and select **Create project** from the **Fully-managed projects** panel.

3. Edit your project settings.

   **Cloud provider**: The cloud platform where you’ll deploy your project. We currently support Amazon Web Services (AWS).

   **Region**: The cloud platform’s region where your project will live. The region should be as close as possible to the location of your data.

   You can also check [the pricing details](https://cloud.elastic.co/pricing) to see how you consume Elasticsearch Serverless.

4. Select **Create project**. It takes a few minutes before your project gets created. 

Once the project is ready, select **Continue** to open the **Get started with Elasticsearch** main page. From here, you can select your favorite language client, ingest data, and start searching and exploring within minutes.

## Ingest

## Search

Now search for documents in the `books` index that contain the word `snow`:

    Run a search using the `search` API:

    ```ruby
    response = client.search(index: 'books', q: 'snow')
    response['hits']['hits']
    ```

    Result:
    
    ```ruby
    [{"_index"=>"books", "_id"=>"Pdink4cBmDx329iqhzM2", "_score"=>1.5904956, "_source"=>{"name"=>"Snow Crash", "author"=>"Neal Stephenson", "release_date"=>"1992-06-01", "page_count"=>470}}]
    ```
  </DocTab>
  <DocTab name="curl">
    Run a search using the `_search` API:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET '/books/_search' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "match": { "_all": "snow" }
        }
    }'
    ```
