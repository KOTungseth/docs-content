Follow along to set up your ((es-serverless)) project and get started with some sample documents.
Then, choose how to continue with your own data.

## Create project

Use your ((ecloud)) account to create a fully-managed ((es-serverless)) project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](((ess-console))) and create a new account or log in to your existing account.

1. Within **Fully-managed projects**, choose **Create project**.

1. Choose the **((es-serverless))** project type.

1. Provide a name for the project and optionally edit the project settings, such as the cloud platform region.
   Select **Create project** to continue.

1. Once the project is ready, select **Continue**.

You should now see **Get started with ((es))**, and you're ready to continue.

## Create API key

Create an API key, which will enable you to access the ((es)) API to ingest and search data.

1. Scroll to **Add an API Key** and select **New**.

1. In **Create an API key**, enter a name for your key and its expiration.
   Select **Create API Key** to finish.

The API key is displayed as a set of values, including `id`, `name`, `expiration`, `api_key`, and `encoded`.
Store this information securelyâ€”it is displayed only once.

You will use the `encoded` value when sending API requests.

## Copy URL

Next, copy the URL of your API endpoint.
You'll send all ((es)) API requests to this URL.

1. Scroll to **Copy your connection details**.

1. Find the value for **Elasticsearch Endpoint**.

Store this value along with your `encoded` API key.
You'll use both values in the next step.

## Test connection

We'll use the `curl` command to test your connection and make additional API requests.
(See [Install curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) if you need to install this program.)

`curl` will need access to your Cloud URL and `encoded` API key.
Within your terminal, assign these values to the `ES_URL` and `API_KEY` environment variables.

For example:

```bash
export ES_URL="https://dda7de7f1d264286a8fc9741c7741690.es.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud:443"
export API_KEY="ZFZRbF9Jb0JDMEoxaVhoR2pSa3Q6dExwdmJSaldRTHFXWEp4TFFlR19Hdw=="
```

Then run the following command to test your connection:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "name" : "serverless",
  "cluster_name" : "dda7de7f1d264286a8fc9741c7741690",
  "cluster_uuid" : "ws0IbTBUQfigmYAVMztkZQ",
  "version" : { ... },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Now you're ready to ingest and search some sample documents.

## Ingest data

To ingest data, you must create an index and store some documents.
This process is also called "indexing".

You can index multiple documents using a single `POST` request to the `_bulk` API endpoint.
The request body specifies the documents to store and the indices in which to store them.

((es)) will automatically create the index and map each document value to one of its data types.
Include the `?pretty` option to receive a human-readable response.

Run the following command to index some sample documents into the `books` index:

```bash
curl -X POST "${ES_URL}/_bulk?pretty" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Snow Crash", "author": "Neal Stephenson", "release_date": "1992-06-01", "page_count": 470}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Revelation Space", "author": "Alastair Reynolds", "release_date": "2000-03-15", "page_count": 585}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 328}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Fahrenheit 451", "author": "Ray Bradbury", "release_date": "1953-10-15", "page_count": 227}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley", "release_date": "1932-06-01", "page_count": 268}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "The Handmaids Tale", "author": "Margaret Atwood", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 311}
'
```

You should receive a response indicating there were no errors:

```json
{
  "errors" : false,
  "took" : 1260,
  "items" : [ ... ]
}
```

## Search data

To search, send a `POST` request to the `_search` endpoint, specifying the index to search.
Use the ((es)) query DSL to construct your request body.

Run the following command to search the `books` index for documents containing `snow`:

```bash
curl -X POST "${ES_URL}/books/_search?pretty" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "snow"
    }
  }
}
'
```

You should receive a response with the results:

```json
{
  "took" : 24,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.5904956,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "books",
        "_id" : "Z3hf_IoBONQ5TXnpLdlY",
        "_score" : 1.5904956,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Snow Crash",
          "author" : "Neal Stephenson",
          "release_date" : "1992-06-01",
          "page_count" : 470
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Continue on your own

Congratulations!
You've set up an ((es-serverless)) project, and you've ingested and searched some sample data.
Now you're ready to continue on your own.

### Explore

Want to explore the sample documents or your own data?

By creating a data view, you can explore data using several UI tools, such as Discover or Dashboards. Or, use ((es)) aggregations to explore your data using the API. Find more information in <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourData" />.
