<div id="create-and-manage-rules"></div>

The **((stack-manage-app))** > **((rules-ui))** UI provides a cross-app view of alerting.
Different ((kib)) apps like [*((observability))*](((observability-guide))/create-alerts.html),
[*Security*](((security-guide))/prebuilt-rules.html), <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaGeoAlerting">**Maps**</DocLink> */} and
 <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/* <DocLink id="enKibanaXpackMl">**((ml-app))**</DocLink> */} can offer their own rules. **((rules-ui))** provides a
central place to:

* <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataCreateAnAlert" section="create-and-edit-rules">Create and edit</DocLink> rules
* <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataCreateAnAlert" section="snooze-and-disable-rules">Manage rules</DocLink> including enabling/disabling, muting/unmuting, and deleting
* Drill down to <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataCreateAnAlert" section="view-rule-details">rule details</DocLink>
* Configure settings that apply to all rules in the space

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Example rule listing in ((rules-ui))](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rules-ui.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

For more information on alerting concepts and the types of rules and connectors
available, go to <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataAlerting">Alerting</DocLink>.

## Required permissions

Access to rules is granted based on your ((alert-features)) privileges. For
more information, go to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaAlertingSetup" section="security">Security</DocLink> */}.

<div id="create-edit-rules"></div>

## Create and edit rules

Some rules must be created within the context of a ((kib)) app like
 <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/* <DocLink id="enKibanaObservability" section="metrics">Metrics</DocLink> */}, <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaXpackApm">APM</DocLink> */}, or <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaObservability" section="uptime">Uptime</DocLink> */}, but others
are generic. Generic rule types can be created in **((rules-ui))** by clicking the
**Create rule** button. This will launch a flyout that guides you through selecting
a rule type and configuring its conditions and actions.

After a rule is created, you can open the action menu (â€¦) and select **Edit rule**
to re-open the flyout and change the rule properties.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also manage rules as resources with the [Elasticstack provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest) for Terraform.
For more details, refer to the [elasticstack_kibana_alerting_rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/kibana_alerting_rule) resource.

<div id="defining-rules-type-conditions"></div>

### Rule type and conditions

Depending on the ((kib)) app and context, you might be prompted to choose the type of rule to create. Some apps will preselect the type of rule for you.

Each rule type provides its own way of defining the conditions to detect, but an expression formed by a series of clauses is a common pattern. For example, in a metric threshold rule, the `WHEN` clause enables you to select an aggregation operation to apply to a numeric field.

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage size="l" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-flyout-rule-conditions.png" alt="UI for defining rule conditions on a metric threshold rule" /> */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

All rules must have a check interval, which defines how often to evaluate the rule conditions. Checks are queued; they run as close to the defined value as capacity allows.

For details on what types of rules are available and how to configure them, refer to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaRuleTypes">Rule types</DocLink> */}.

<div id="defining-rules-actions-details"></div>

### Actions

You can add one or more actions to your rule to generate notifications when its
conditions are met and when they are no longer met.

Each action uses a connector, which provides connection information for a ((kib)) service or third party integration, depending on where you want to send the notifications. If no connectors exist, click **Add connector** to create one.

After you select a connector, set the action frequency. If the rule type supports alert summaries, you can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, if you create a metrics threshold rule, you can send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts each day:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage size="l" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-flyout-action-summary.png" alt="UI for defining rule conditions on a metric threshold rule" /> */}

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
If you choose a custom action interval, it cannot be shorter than the rule's check interval.
</DocCallOut>

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that the action runs for each alert. If the rule type does not support alert summaries, this is your only available option. You must choose when the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval). You must also choose an action group, which affects whether the action runs (for example, the action runs when the issue is detected or when it is recovered). Each rule type has a specific set of valid action groups.

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage size="l" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-flyout-action-details.png" alt="UI for defining an email action" /> */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

If you create rules in the ((security-app)), you can further refine when actions run by adding time frame and query filters.
For more details, refer to [Create a detection rule](((security-guide))/rules-ui-create.html).

Each connector enables different action properties. For example, an email connector enables you to set the recipients, the subject, and a message body in markdown format. For more information about connectors, refer to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaActionTypes">Connectors</DocLink> */}.

<DocCallOut id="alerting-concepts-suppressing-duplicate-notifications" title="Tip">

If you are not using alert summaries, actions are triggered per alert and a rule can end up generating a large number of actions. Take the following example where a rule is monitoring three servers every minute for CPU usage > 0.9, and the action frequency is `On check intervals`:

* Minute 1: server X123 > 0.9. _One email_ is sent for server X123.
* Minute 2: X123 and Y456 > 0.9. _Two emails_ are sent, one for X123 and one for Y456.
* Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 > 0.9. _Three emails_ are sent, one for each of X123, Y456, Z789.

In this example, three emails are sent for server X123 in the span of 3 minutes for the same rule. Often, it's desirable to suppress these re-notifications. If
you set the action frequency to `On custom action intervals` with an interval of 5 minutes, you reduce noise by getting emails only every 5 minutes for
servers that continue to exceed the threshold:

* Minute 1: server X123 > 0.9. _One email_ will be sent for server X123.
* Minute 2: X123 and Y456 > 0.9. _One email_ will be sent for Y456.
* Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 > 0.9. _One email_ will be sent for Z789.

To get notified only once when a server exceeds the threshold, you can set the action frequency to `On status changes`. Alternatively, if the rule type supports alert summaries, consider using them to reduce the volume of notifications.

### Action variables

You can pass rule values to an action at the time a condition is detected.
To view the list of variables available for your rule, click the "add rule variable" button:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage size="l" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-flyout-action-variables.png" alt="Passing rule values to an action" /> */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

For more information about common action variables, refer to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaRuleActionVariables">Rule action variables</DocLink> */}.

<div id="controlling-rules"></div>

## Snooze and disable rules

The rule listing enables you to quickly snooze, disable, enable, or delete
individual rules. For example, you can change the state of a rule:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Use the rule status dropdown to enable or disable an individual rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-individual-enable-disable.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

When you snooze a rule, the rule checks continue to run on a schedule but the
alert will not trigger any actions. You can snooze for a specified period of
time, indefinitely, or schedule single or recurring downtimes:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Snooze notifications for a rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-snooze-panel.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

When a rule is in a snoozed state, you can cancel or change the duration of
this state.

<DocBadge template="technical preview" />  To temporarily suppress notifications for _all_ rules, create a <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaMaintenanceWindows">maintenance window</DocLink> */}.

<div id="importing-and-exporting-rules"></div>

## Import and export rules

To import and export rules, use <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaManagingSavedObjects">Saved Objects</DocLink> */}.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

Some rule types cannot be exported through this interface:

**Security rules** can be imported and exported using the [Security UI](((security-guide))/rules-ui-management.html#import-export-rules-ui).

**Stack monitoring rules** are <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaKibanaAlerts">automatically created</DocLink> */} for you and therefore cannot be managed in **Saved Objects**.

</DocCallOut>

Rules are disabled on export. You are prompted to re-enable the rule on successful import.
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage size="l" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rules-imported-banner.png" alt="Rules import banner" /> */}

<div id="rule-details"></div>

## View rule details

You can determine the health of a rule by looking at the **Last response** in **((stack-manage-app))** > **((rules-ui))**.
A rule can have one of the following responses:

`failed`
  : The rule ran with errors.
`succeeded`
  : The rule ran without errors.
`warning`
    : The rule ran with some non-critical errors.

Click the rule name to access a rule details page:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Rule details page with multiple alerts](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-details-alerts-active.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

In this example, the rule detects when a site serves more than a threshold number of bytes in a 24 hour period. Four sites are above the threshold. These are called alerts - occurrences of the condition being detected - and the alert name, status, time of detection, and duration of the condition are shown in this view. Alerts come and go from the list depending on whether the rule conditions are met.

When an alert is created, it generates actions. If the conditions that caused the alert persist, the actions run again according to the rule notification settings. There are three common alert statuses:

`active`
  : The conditions for the rule are met and actions should be generated according to the notification settings.
`flapping`
  : The alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states.
`recovered`
    : The conditions for the rule are no longer met and recovery actions should be generated.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The `flapping` state is possible only if you have enabled alert flapping detection in **((stack-manage-app))** > **((rules-ui))** > **Settings**. For each space, you can choose a look back window and threshold that are used to determine whether alerts are flapping. For example, you can specify that the alert must change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.
</DocCallOut>

If there are rule actions that failed to run successfully, you can see the details on the **History** tab.
In the **Message** column, click the warning or expand icon <div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* <DocImage flatImage alt="double arrow icon to open a flyout with the document details" url="images/create-and-manage-rules/discover-expand-icon-2.png" /> */} or click the number in the **Errored actions** column to open the **Errored Actions** panel.
In this example, the action failed because the <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaAlertActionSettingsKb" section="action-config-email-domain-allowlist">`xpack.actions.email.domain_allowlist`</DocLink> */} setting was updated and the action's email recipient is no longer included in the allowlist:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Rule histor page with alerts that have errored actions](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-details-errored-actions.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

If an alert was affected by a maintenance window, its identifier appears in the **Maintenance windows** column.
For more information about their impact on alert notifications, refer to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaMaintenanceWindows">Maintenance windows</DocLink> */}.

You can suppress future actions for a specific alert by turning on the **Mute** toggle. If a muted alert no longer meets the rule conditions, it stays in the list to avoid generating actions if the conditions recur. You can also disable a rule, which stops it from running checks and clears any alerts it was tracking. You may want to disable rules that are not currently needed to reduce the load on ((kib)) and ((es)).

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Use the disable toggle to turn off rule checks and clear alerts tracked](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-rule-details-disabling.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}
