Within an organization, users can have one or more roles and each role grants specific privileges. 

You can set a role for all projects of a specific type (Elasticsearch, Observability, Security). This also applies to new projects that will be created for that specific type.
In alternative, you can set a role for each individual project. To do that, you have to set the role for all projects of that specific type to **None**.
