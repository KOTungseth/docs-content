Within an organization, users can have one or more roles and each role grants specific privileges. 

You can set a role for all projects, or a specific role individually for each project. To apply individual roles per project, you must set the role for all projects to **None**.

The following roles are common to all project types:

- **Organization owner**. This role is assigned by default to the person who created the organization. Can manage all roles under the organization and has full access to all serverless projects, organization-level details, billing details, and subscription levels. The organization owner can manage the organization’s extensions, bundles, API keys, and traffic filters.

- **Billing admin**. Can manage an organization’s billing details, has access to all invoices and payment methods, and can make subscription changes.

In addition to the common roles, each project type has a predefined set of roles. This list describes the scope of the different roles per project.
