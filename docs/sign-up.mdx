You have a few options to get started with serverless on Elastic Cloud:

- If you are an existing customer, [log in to Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/login). On the home page, you will see a new option to create serverless projects. Note that if you are already subscribed to Elastic Cloud, there is no specific trial for serverless projects. 

- If you are a new user, you can [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration), and you will be able to launch a serverless project.

## What is included in my trial?

Your free 14-day trial includes:

**One hosted deployment**

 A deployment lets you explore Elastic solutions for Search, Observability, and Security. Trial deployments run on the latest version of the Elastic Stack. They includes 8 GB of RAM spread out over two availability zones, and enough storage space to get you started. If you’re looking to evaluate a smaller workload, you can scale down your trial deployment.
Each deployment includes Elastic features such as Maps, SIEM, machine learning, advanced security, and much more. You have some sample data sets to play with and tutorials that describe how to add your own data.

**One serverless project**

 Serverless projects package Elastic Stack features by type of solution: 

- [Elasticsearch](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/what-is-elasticsearch-serverless)
- [Observability](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/observability/what-is-observability-serverless)
- [Security](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/security/what-is-security-serverless)

When you create a project, you select the project type applicable to your use case, so only the relevant and impactful applications and features are easily accessible to you.

	During the trial period, you are limited to one active hosted deployment and one active serverless project at a time. When you subscribe, these limitations are removed and you can create additional deployments and projects.

## What limits are in place during a trial?

Elastic provides access to a hosted deployment and a serverless project during trial. If all you want to do is try out Elastic, the trial includes more than enough to get you started. Some limits are in place during the trial period which are shown below.

**For hosted deployments**

- You can have one active deployment at a time
- The deployment size is limited to 8GB RAM and approximately 360GB of storage (depending on the hardware profile selected)
- Machine learning nodes are available up to 4GB RAM
- Custom Elasticsearch plugins are not enabled

**For serverless projects**

- You can have one active serverless project at a time.
- Search Power is limited to 100 (for Elasticsearch project types only)
- Search Boost Window is limited to 7 days (for Elasticsearch project types only)

**How to lift restrictions?**

These limitations are lifted when you [subscribe to Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-details.html). Once subscribed, you'll for example be able to:

- Increase the memory or storage of any of the components of your deployment, like the Elasticsearch cluster, machine learning nodes, or the APM server.
- Create multiple deployments and projects.
- Add a third availability zone for your deployments.
- Access additional features, such as cross-cluster search or cross-cluster replication.

You can subscribe at any time during your trial. From that moment, billing will start. To maximize the benefits of your trial, it is best to subscribe towards the end of the free period. In the meantime, you can check your [account usage](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-account-usage.html) and [billing history](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-history.html) to monitor charges, anticipate future costs, and adjust your usage.

## How do I get started with my trial?

Start by checking out some common approaches for [moving data into Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html#ec-ingest-methods).

## What happens at the end of the trial?

At the end of the trial, any active deployments and projects will be suspended if you have not [subscribed to Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-details.html). Once you subscribe, you will be able to resume your deployment or serverless project and regain access to any data that you had previously ingested. If you do not subscribe to Elastic Cloud within 30 days, your deployment and serverless project, along with your data, are permanently deleted.

If you’re interested in learning about more ways to subscribe to Elastic Cloud, don’t hesitate to [contact us](https://www.elastic.co/contact).

## How do I sign up through a Marketplace?

If you’re interested in consolidated billing, you’ll want to subscribe from a Marketplace. This skips over your trial period and connects your Marketplace email to your unique Elastic account.

<DocCallOut title="">
	Serverless projects are not yet available for Elastic Cloud accounts configured under the GCP Marketplace and Azure Marketplace. We will be adding support for these marketplaces in the near future.
