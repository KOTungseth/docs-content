This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Python 
client, shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

## Installation

### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Python client with the following 
commands:

```bash

```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Cloud URL:

```php

```

To get an API key or Cloud URL for the project, see <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchGetStarted" />.


## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can use
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```python

```

When you use the client to make a request to Elasticsearch, it returns an API 
response object. You can check the HTTP return code by calling `status` and the 
HTTP headers by calling `headers` on the response object. The response object 
also behaves as a Hash, so you can access the body values directly as seen on 
the previous example with ``.


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```python

```

### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```python

```

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```python

```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```python

```


### Deleting an index


```python

```
