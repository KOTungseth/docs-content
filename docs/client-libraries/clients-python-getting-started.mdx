This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Python 
client, shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* <DocLink id="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/" text="`pip`" />

## Installation

### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Python client with the following 
commands:

```bash
python -m pip install elasticsearch_serverless
```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Cloud URL:

```python
from elasticsearch_serverless import Elasticsearch

client = Elasticsearch(
    cloud_id="my-cloud-url",  # Cloud ID provided by Elastic
    api_key=('api-key-id', 'api-key-secret'),  # API key ID and secret
)
```

To get API keys or the Cloud URL for a project, see <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchGetStarted" />.


## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can use
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```python
client.indices.create(index="books")
TO DO
```


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```python
client.get(index="my_index", id="my_document_id")
```

### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```python
client.search(index="books", query={
    "match": {
        "name": "snow"
    }
})
```

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```python

```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```python
client.delete(index="books", id="my_document_id")
```


### Deleting an index


```python
client.indices.delete(index="my_index")
```
