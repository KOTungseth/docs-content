This page guides you through the installation process of the ((es-serverless)) PHP  
client, shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic 
((es)) operations with it.


## Requirements

* PHP x or higher installed on your system.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the ((es-serverless)) PHP client with the following 
commands:

```bash

```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Cloud URL:

```php

```

To get API keys or the Cloud URL for a project, see <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchGetStarted" />.

## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can use
the `bulk` API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```php

```

When you use the client to make a request to ((es)), it returns an API 
response object. You can check the HTTP return code by calling `status` and the 
HTTP headers by calling `headers` on the response object. The response object 
also behaves as a Hash, so you can access the body values directly as seen on 
the previous example with ``.

### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```php

```


### Searching

You can search your documents using the **Search API**:

```php

```


### Updating documents

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field:

```php

```

### Deleting documents


```php

```


### Deleting an index


```php

```
