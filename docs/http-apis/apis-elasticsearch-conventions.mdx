import InReview from '../partials/in-review-notice.mdx'

<InReview />

You can run ((es)) API requests in **((dev-tools-app)) > Console**.
For example:

```sh
GET _cat/indices?v=true
```

Check out <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchDevToolsConsole" />.

## Request headers

When you call ((es)) APIs outside of the Console, you must provide a request header.
The ((es)) APIs support the `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `traceparent`, and `X-Opaque-Id` headers.

### Authorization

((es)) APIs use key-based authentication.
You must create an API key and use the encoded value in the request header.
For example:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}"
```

To learn about creating keys, go to <DocLink id="serverlessApiKeys"/>.

### Content-type

The type of the content sent in a request body must be specified using the `Content-Type` header.
The value of this header must map to one of the supported formats that the API supports.
Most APIs support JSON, YAML, CBOR, and SMILE.
The bulk and multi-search APIs support NDJSON, JSON, and SMILE; other types will result in an error response.

When using the `source` query string parameter, the content type must be specified using the `source_content_type` query string parameter.

((es)) APIs support only UTF-8-encoded JSON.
Any other encoding headings sent with a request are ignored.
Responses are also UTF-8 encoded.

### Traceparent

((es)) APIs support a `traceparent` HTTP header using the [official W3C trace context spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header).
You can use the `traceparent` header to trace requests across Elastic products and other services.
Because it's used only for traces, you can safely generate a unique `traceparent` header for each request.

((es)) APIs surface the header's `trace-id` value as `trace.id` in the:

* JSON ((es)) server logs
* Slow logs
* Deprecation logs

{/* MISSING LINKS

* \<\<_identifying_search_slow_log_origin,Slow logs>>
* <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enElasticsearchReferenceLogging" section="deprecation-logging">Deprecation logs</DocLink>
*/}

For example, the following `traceparent` value would produce the following
`trace.id` value in the logs:

```txt
`traceparent`: 00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01
`trace.id`: 0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c
```

### X-Opaque-Id

You can pass an `X-Opaque-Id` HTTP header to track the origin of a request in ((es)) logs and tasks.
((es)) surfaces the `X-Opaque-Id` value in the:

* Response of any request that includes the header
* Task management API response
* Slow logs
* Deprecation logs

{/* MISSING LINKS
* Response of any request that includes the header
* \<\<_identifying_running_tasks,Task management API>> response
* \<\<_identifying_search_slow_log_origin,Slow logs>>
* <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enElasticsearchReferenceLogging" section="deprecation-logging">Deprecation logs</DocLink>
*/}
For the deprecation logs, ((es)) also uses the `X-Opaque-Id` value to throttle
and deduplicate deprecation warnings.
{/* MISSING LINKS
See \<\<_deprecation_logs_throttling>>.
*/}

The `X-Opaque-Id` header accepts any arbitrary value.
However, it is recommended that you limit these values to a finite set, such as an ID per client.
Don't generate a unique `X-Opaque-Id` header for every request.
Too many unique `X-Opaque-Id` values can prevent ((es)) from deduplicating warnings in the deprecation logs.

<div id="get-requests"></div>

## Request bodies

A number of ((es)) APIs with GET operations--most notably the search API--support a request body.
While the GET operation makes sense in the context of retrieving information, GET requests with a body are not supported by all HTTP libraries.

All ((es)) APIs with GET operations that require a body can also be submitted as POST requests.
Alternatively, you can pass the request body as the `source` query string parameter when using GET.
When you use this method, the `source_content_type` parameter should also be passed with a media type value that indicates the formatof the source, such as `application/json`.

<div id="api-cron-expressions"></div>

## Cron expressions

A cron expression is a string of the following form:

```shell
<seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day_of_month> <month> <day_of_week> [year]
```
((es)) APIs use the cron parser from the [Quartz Job Scheduler](https://quartz-scheduler.org). 
For more information about writing Quartz cron expressions, see the [Quartz CronTrigger Tutorial](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).

All schedule times are in coordinated universal time (UTC); other timezones are not supported.

<DocCallOut title="You can use the elasticsearch-croneval command line tool to validate your cron expressions." />

<div id="cron-special-characters"></div>

### Cron special characters

{/* DocDefList is used since basic definition list fails for special characters. */}

<DocDefList>
  <DocDefTerm>*</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  (Required)
  Selects every possible value for a field.
  For example, `*` in the `hours` field means "every hour".
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>?</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  No specific value. Use when you don't care what the value is.
  For example, if you want the schedule to trigger on a particular day of the month, but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, you can specify `?` in the `day_of_week` field.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>-</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  A range of values (inclusive).
  Use to separate a minimum and maximum value.
  For example, if you want the schedule to trigger every hour between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., you could specify `9-17` in the `hours` field.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>,</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  Multiple values.
  Use to separate multiple values for a field.
  For example, if you want the schedule to trigger every Tuesday and Thursday, you could specify `TUE,THU` in the `day_of_week` field.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>/</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  Increment.
  Use to separate values when specifying a time increment.
  The first value represents the starting point, and the second value represents the interval.
  For example, if you want the schedule to trigger every 20 minutes starting at the top of the hour, you could specify `0/20` in the `minutes` field.
  Similarly, specifying `1/5` in `day_of_month` field will trigger every 5 days starting on the first day of the month.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm> L</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  Last.
  Use in the `day_of_month` field to mean the last day of the month--day 31 for January, day 28 for February in non-leap years, day 30 for April, and so on.
  Use alone in the `day_of_week` field in place of `7` or `SAT`, or after a particular day of the week to select the last day of that type in the month.
  For example `6L` means the last Friday of the month.
  You can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month` field to specify the last weekday of the month.
  Avoid using the `L` option when specifying lists or ranges of values, as the results likely won't be what you expect.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>W</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  Weekday.
  Use to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.
  As an example, if you specify `15W` in the `day_of_month` field and the 15th is a Saturday, the schedule will trigger on the 14th.
  If the 15th is a Sunday, the schedule will trigger on Monday the 16th.
  If the 15th is a Tuesday, the schedule will trigger on Tuesday the 15th.
  However if you specify `1W` as the value for `day_of_month`, and the 1st is a Saturday, the schedule will trigger on Monday the 3rd--it won't jump over the month boundary.
  You can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month` field to specify the last weekday of the month. You can only use the `W` option when the `day_of_month` is a single day--it is not valid when specifying a range or list of days.
  </DocDefDescription>

  <DocDefTerm>#</DocDefTerm>
  <DocDefDescription>
  Nth XXX day in a month.
  Use in the `day_of_week` field to specify the nth XXX day of the month.
  For example, if you specify `6#1`, the schedule will trigger on the first Friday of the month.
  Note that if you specify `3#5` and there are not 5 Tuesdays in a particular month, the schedule won't trigger that month.
  </DocDefDescription>

<div id="api-date-math-index-names"></div>

## Date math support in index and index alias names

Date math name resolution lets you to search a range of time series indices or index aliases rather than searching all of your indices and filtering the results.
Limiting the number of searched indices reduces cluster load and improves search performance.
For example, if you are searching for errors in your daily logs, you can use a date math name template to restrict the search to the past two days.

Most ((es)) APIs that accept an index or index alias argument support date math.
A date math name takes the following form:

```txt
<static_name{date_math_expr{date_format|time_zone}}>
```

Where:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| `static_name` | Static text |
| `date_math_expr` | Dynamic date math expression that computes the date dynamically |
| `date_format` | Optional format in which the computed date should be rendered. Defaults to `yyyy.MM.dd`. Format should be compatible with java-time https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html |
| `time_zone` | Optional time zone. Defaults to `UTC`. |

<DocCallOut title="Pay attention to the use of lower and uppercase letters in the date_format.">
For example, `mm` denotes minute of hour, while `MM` denotes month of year. Similarly `hh` denotes the hour in the
`1-12` range in combination with `AM/PM`, while `HH` denotes the hour in the `0-23` 24-hour range.
</DocCallOut>

Date math expressions are resolved locale-independent.
Consequently, it is not possible to use any other calendars than the Gregorian calendar.

You must enclose date math names in angle brackets.
If you use the name in a request path, special characters must be URI encoded.
For example:

```console
# PUT /<my-index-{now/d}>
PUT /%3Cmy-index-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E
```

The special characters used for date rounding must be URI encoded.
For example:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| `<` | `%3C` |
| `>` | `%3E` |
| `/` | `%2F` |
| `{` | `%7B` |
| `}` | `%7D` |
| `\|` | `%7C` |
| `+` | `%2B` |
| `:` | `%3A` |
| `,` | `%2C` |

The following example shows different forms of date math names and the final names they resolve to given the current time is 22nd March 2024 noon UTC:

| Expression | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `<logstash-{now/d}>`                      | `logstash-2024.03.22` |
| `<logstash-{now/M}>`                      | `logstash-2024.03.01` |
| `<logstash-{now/M{yyyy.MM}}>`             | `logstash-2024.03` |
| `<logstash-{now/M-1M{yyyy.MM}}>`          | `logstash-2024.02` |
| `<logstash-{now/d{yyyy.MM.dd\|+12:00}}>`  | `logstash-2024.03.23` |

To use the characters `{` and `}` in the static part of a name template, escape themwith a backslash `\`.
For example, `<elastic\\{ON\\}-{now/M}>` resolves to `elastic{ON}-2024.03.01`

The following example shows a search request that searches the ((ls)) indices for the past
three days, assuming the indices use the default ((ls)) index name format,
(`logstash-YYYY.MM.dd`):

```console
# GET /<logstash-{now/d-2d}>,<logstash-{now/d-1d}>,<logstash-{now/d}>/_search
GET /%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd-2d%7D%3E%2C%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd-1d%7D%3E%2C%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E/_search
{
  "query" : {
    "match": {
      "test": "data"
    }
  }
}
```
{/* TBD: Snippet testing */}
{/* TEST[s/^/PUT logstash-2016.09.20\nPUT logstash-2016.09.19\nPUT logstash-2016.09.18\n/] */}
{/* TEST[s/now/2016.09.20%7C%7C/] */}

## Multi-target syntax

Most ((es)) APIs that accept a `<data-stream>`, `<index>`, or `<target>` request path parameter also support _multi-target syntax_.

In multi-target syntax, you can use a comma-separated list to run a request on multiple resources, such as data streams, indices, or aliases.
You can also use [glob-like](((wikipedia))/Glob_(programming)) wildcard (`*`) expressions to target resources that match a pattern.
For example, `test*`, `*test`, `te*t`, or `*test*`.

You can exclude targets using the `-` character.
For example, `test*,-test3`.

<DocCallOut title="Aliases are resolved after wildcard expressions." color="warning">
This can result in a request that targets an excluded alias.
For example, if `test3` is an index alias, the pattern `test*,-test3` still targets the indices for `test3`. 
To avoid this, exclude the concrete indices for the alias instead.
</DocCallOut>

{/* 
TBD: Is this section related to cross-cluster searches? Is it applicable to serverless?
You can also exclude clusters from a list of clusters to search using the `-` character.
For example, `remote*:*,-remote1:*,-remote4:*` will search all clusters with an alias that starts with "remote" except for "remote1" and "remote4".
Note that to exclude a cluster with this notation you must exclude all of its indexes.
Excluding a subset of indexes on a remote cluster is currently not supported.
For example, `remote*:*,-remote1:logs*` this will throw an exception. */}

<div id="multi-hidden"></div>
### Hidden data streams and indices

For most APIs, wildcard expressions do not match hidden data streams and indices by default.
To match hidden data streams and indices using a wildcard expression, you must specify the `expand_wildcards` query parameter.

Alternatively, querying an index pattern starting with a dot, such as `.alerting_hist*`, will match hidden indices by default.
This is intended to mirror UNIX file-globbing behavior and provide a smoother transition path to hidden indices.

You can create hidden data streams by setting `data_stream.hidden` to `true` in the stream's matching index template.
You can hide indices using the `index.hidden` index setting.

{/* MISSING LINK:

<DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge><DocLink id="enElasticsearchReferenceIndexModules" section="index-hidden">`index.hidden`</DocLink>
*/}

The backing indices for data streams are hidden automatically.
Some features, such as ((ml)), store information in hidden indices.

Global index templates that match all indices are not applied to hidden indices.

<div id="system-indices"></div>

### System indices

((es)) modules and plugins can store configuration and state information in internal _system indices_.
You should not directly access or modify system indices as they contain data essential to the operation of the system.

<DocCallOut title="Direct access to system indices is deprecated and
will no longer be allowed in a future major version." color="warning" />

<div id="api-compatibility"></div>


<div id="api-url-access-control"></div>

{/*
TBD: Since this requires access to elasticsearch.yml, is it still valid for Serverless?
## URL-based access control

Many users use a proxy with URL-based access control to secure access to ((es)) data streams and indices.
For multi-search, multi-get, and bulk requests, the user has the choice of specifying a data stream or index in the URL and on each individual request within the request body.
This can make URL-based access control challenging.

To prevent the user from overriding the data stream or index specified in the URL, set `rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index` to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`.

This causes  ((es)) to reject requests that explicitly specify a data stream or index in the request body. */}

## Data types

There are conventions related to the values that you specify in your query parameters and request and response bodies.

### Boolean values

All REST API parameters (both request parameters and JSON body) support providing boolean "false" as the value `false` and boolean "true" as the value `true`.
All other values will raise an error.

### Number values

All REST APIs support providing numbered parameters as `string` on top of supporting the native JSON number types.

### Byte size units

Whenever the byte size of data needs to be specified, the value must specify the unit.
For example, set a buffer size parameter to `10kb` for 10 kilobytes.
Note that these units use powers of 1024, so `1kb` means 1024 bytes.
The supported units are:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| `b` | Bytes |
| `kb` | Kilobytes |
| `mb` | Megabytes |
| `gb` | Gigabytes |
| `tb` | Terabytes |
| `pb` | Petabytes |

<div id="distance-units"></div>

### Distance units

Wherever distances need to be specified, such as the `distance` parameter in the geo-distance query, the default unit is meters.
Distances can be specified in other units, such as `"1km"` or `"2mi"` (2 miles).

The supported units are:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Mile | `mi` or `miles` |
| Yard | `yd` or `yards` |
| Feet | `ft` or `feet` |
| Inch | `in` or `inch` |
| Kilometer | `km` or `kilometers` |
| Meter | `m` or `meters` |
| Centimeter | `cm` or `centimeters` |
| Millimeter | `mm` or `millimeters` |
| Nautical mile | `NM`, `nmi`, or `nauticalmiles` |

<div id="time-units"></div>

### Time units

Whenever durations are specified, it must also specify the unit.
For example, set a `timeout` parameter to `2d` for 2 days.

The supported units are:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| `d` | Days |
| `h` | Hours |
| `m` | Minutes |
| `s` | Seconds |
| `ms` | Milliseconds |
| `micros` | Microseconds |
| `nanos` | Nanoseconds |

<div id="size-units"></div>

### Unit-less quantities

Unit-less quantities means that they don't have a "unit" like "bytes" or "Hertz" or "meter" or "long tonne".

If one of these quantities is large, it will be output with unit modifiers.
For example, `10m` for `10,000,000` or `7k` for `7000`.

These are the supported multipliers:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| `k` | Kilo |
| `m` | Mega |
| `g` | Giga |
| `t` | Tera |
| `p` | Peta |
