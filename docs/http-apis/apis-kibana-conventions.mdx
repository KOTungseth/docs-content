## Using the APIs

Prepend any ((kib)) API endpoint with `kbn:` and send the request through <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchDevToolsConsole">Dev Tools > Console</DocLink>.
For example:

```sh
`GET kbn:/api/index_management/indices`
```

Note: this will automatically prefix `s/{space_id}/` on the API request if ran from a non-default Kibana Space.

### Authentication
The ((kib)) APIs support key- and token-based authentication.

<div id="token-api-authentication"></div>

#### Token-based authentication

To use token-based authentication, you use the same username and password that you use to log into Elastic.
In a given HTTP tool, and when available, you can select to use its 'Basic Authentication' option,
which is where the username and password are stored in order to be passed as part of the call.

<div id="key-authentication"></div>

#### Key-based authentication

To use key-based authentication, you create an API key using the Elastic Console, then specify the key in the header of your API calls.

For information about API keys, refer to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaApiKeys">API keys</DocLink> */}.

<div id="api-calls"></div>

### API calls
API calls are stateless. Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for ((kib)) to fulfill the request. API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.

Calls to the API endpoints require different operations. To interact with the ((kib)) APIs, use the following operations:

* **GET** - Fetches the information.

* **POST** - Adds new information.

* **PUT** - Updates the existing information.

* **DELETE** - Removes the information.

<div id="api-request-headers"></div>

### Request headers

For all APIs, you must use a request header. The ((kib)) APIs support the `kbn-xsrf` and `Content-Type` headers.

`kbn-xsrf: true` 
    : By default, you must use `kbn-xsrf` for all API calls, except in the following scenarios:

* The API endpoint uses the `GET` or `HEAD` operations
* The path is allowed using the <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="settings-xsrf-allowlist">`server.xsrf.allowlist`</DocLink> */} setting
* XSRF protections are disabled using the <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="settings-xsrf-disableProtection">`server.xsrf.disableProtection`</DocLink> */} setting

`Content-Type: application/json` 
    : Applicable only when you send a payload in the API request. ((kib)) API requests and responses use JSON.
    Typically, if you include the `kbn-xsrf` header, you must also include the `Content-Type` header.

Request header example:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5601/api/spaces/space \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' \
  -d '{
	"id": "sales",
	"name": "Sales",
	"description": "This is your Sales Space!",
	"disabledFeatures": []
}
'
```
