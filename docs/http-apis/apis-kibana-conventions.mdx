<InReview />

((kib)) API calls are stateless.
Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for ((kib)) to fulfill the request.
API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.

To interact with the ((kib)) APIs, use the following operations:

- GET: Fetches the information.
- POST: Adds new information.
- PUT: Updates the existing information.
- DELETE: Removes the information.

You can prepend any ((kib)) API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in **((dev-tools-app)) > Console**.
For example:

```sh
GET kbn:/api/data_views
```

Check out <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchDevToolsConsole" />.

## Request headers

When you call ((kib)) APIs outside of the Console, you must provide a request header.
The ((kib)) APIs support the `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, and  `kbn-xsrf` headers.

`Authorization: ApiKey`

: ((kib)) APIs use key-based authentication.
  You must create an API key and use the encoded value in the request header.
  To learn about creating keys, go to <DocLink id="serverlessApiKeys" />.

`Content-Type: application/json`

: You must use this header when you send a payload in the API request.
  Typically, if you include the `kbn-xsrf` header, you must also include the `Content-Type` header.

`kbn-xsrf: true`

: You must use this header for all API calls except `GET` or `HEAD` operations.

{/*
TBD: Are these settings accessible to users in Serverless projects?

This header is also not required when:
* The path is allowed using the `server.xsrf.allowlist` setting
* XSRF protections are disabled using the `server.xsrf.disableProtection` setting
*/}

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "${KIBANA_URL}/api/data_views/data_view" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' \
  -d '{
    "data_view": {
      "title": "books*", 
      "name": "My Books Data View"
      }
    }'
```
