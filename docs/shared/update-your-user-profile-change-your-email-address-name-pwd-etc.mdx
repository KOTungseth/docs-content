## Update your email address

Each {/* book['n'] */} account has a primary email associated with it. By default, the primary email address is used to sign up for {/* book['n'] */} and to log in. If needed, you can change this primary email address:

1. By **Email address**, select **edit**.

1. Enter a new email address and your current password.

    An email is sent to the new address with a link to confirm the change. If you don't get the email after a few minutes, check your spam folder.

If you are using Google or Microsoft Sign-In and would like to change your email address, you will need to:

1. Go to the [Forgot password](https://cloud.elastic.co/forgot) page and enter your email address.
1. Follow the instructions in the "Reset your password" email.
1. In the {/* book['console'] */}, update your [User settings](https://cloud.elastic.co/user/settings) to the new email address.

## Change your password

When you signed up for an {/* book['n'] */} account with your email address, you selected a password that you use to log in to the console. If needed, you can change this password.

If you know your current password:

1. {/* book['login'] */}

1. Open the user menu in the header bar.

1. Go to **Profile**.

1. Select **Change password**.

1. Enter the current password and provide the new password that you want to use.

If you don't know your current password:

1. At the login screen for the {/* book['console'] */}, select the link **Forgot password?**.

1. Enter the primary email address for your account and select **Reset password**.

    By default, to sign up for {/* book['n'] */} you use your primary email address. If you change it at some point, use your current email address to log in to {/* book['n'] */}.

    An email is sent to the address you specified with a link to reset the password. If you don't get the email after a few minutes, check your spam folder.

## Change your login method

You can switch between Google or Microsoft Sign-In and a password-based login, if you need to.

* To switch from Google or Microsoft Sign-In to password-based login, go to the [Forgot password](https://cloud.elastic.co/forgot) page and enter your email address. This will trigger the forgot password flow and will allow you to create a password for your account. After you create a password, log in and navigate to [User settings](https://cloud.elastic.co/user/settings). You will now be able to change the email address.
* To switch from password-based login to Google or Microsoft Sign-In, go to the [Login](https://cloud.elastic.co/login) page and select **Log in with Google** or **Log in with Microsoft**.

## Enable multi-factor authentication

To add an extra layer of security to your {/* book['n'] */} account, you can either set up Google authenticator or text messaging on a mobile device.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Before you start using multi-factor authentication, verify that your device has SMS capabilities or download the Google Authenticator application onto your device.
</DocCallOut>

To enable multi-factor authentication, you must enroll your device.

1. {/* book['login'] */}

1. Go to [User settings](https://cloud.elastic.co/user/settings) and choose **Profile**. Navigate to the **Multi-factor authentication** section.

1. Select **Configure** to enable the Authenticator app or **Add a phone number** to enable the Text message.

If the device you want to remove is your only enrolled device, you must disable multi-factor authentication first.
