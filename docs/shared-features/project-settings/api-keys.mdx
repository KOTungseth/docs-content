API keys are security mechanisms used to authenticate and authorize access to ((stack)) resources.
They ensure that only authorized users or applications interact with the ((stack)).

For example, if you extract data from an ((es)) cluster on a daily basis, you might create an API key tied to your credentials, configure it with minimum access, and then put the API credentials into a cron job.
Or, you might create API keys to automate ingestion of new data from remote sources, without a live user interaction.

You can manage your keys in **((project-settings)) > ((manage-app)) > ((api-keys-app))**:

{/* TBD: This image was refreshed but should be automated */}

A _personal API key_ allows external services to access the ((stack)) on behalf of a user.
{/* Cross-Cluster API key: allows remote clusters to connect to your local cluster. */}
A _managed API key_ is created and managed by ((kib)) to correctly run background tasks.

{/* TBD (accurate?) Secondary credentials have the same or lower access rights. */}

{/* ## Security privileges

You must have the `manage_security`, `manage_api_key`, or the `manage_own_api_key` 
cluster privileges to use API keys in Elastic.  API keys can also be seen in a readonly view with access to the page and the `read_security` cluster privilege. To manage roles, open the main menu, then click 
**Stack Management > Roles**, or use the <DocLink id="enKibanaRoleManagementApi">Role Management API</DocLink>.  */}

## Create an API key

In **((api-keys-app))**, click **Create API key**:

!["Create API key UI"](images/create-personal-api-key.png)

Once created, you can copy the encoded API key and use it to send requests to the ((es)) HTTP API. For example:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}"
```

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
API keys are intended for programmatic access. Don't use API keys to authenticate access using a web browser.
</DocCallOut>

## Update an API key

In **((api-keys-app))**, click on the name of the key.
You can only update the `Restrict privileges` and `Include metadata` fields.

{/* TBD: Refer to the update API key documentation to learn more about updating personal API keys. */}

## View and delete API keys

The **((api-keys-app))** app lists your API keys, including the name, date created, and status.
If an API key expires, its status changes from `Active` to `Expired`.

{/* 
TBD: RBAC requirements for serverless?
If you have `manage_security` or `manage_api_key` permissions,
you can view the API keys of all users, and see which API key was
created by which user in which realm.
If you have only the `manage_own_api_key` permission, you see only a list of your own keys. */}

You can delete API keys individually or in bulk.
