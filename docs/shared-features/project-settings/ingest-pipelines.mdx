This content applies to: <DocBadge template="elasticsearch" slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/what-is-elasticsearch-serverless" /> <DocBadge template="observability" slug="/serverless/observability/what-is-observability-serverless" /> <DocBadge template="security" slug="/serverless/security/what-is-security-serverless" /> 

This topic should pull in rough content from the MDX equivalent of https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html.
We'll need to decide how much content about ingest pipelines to include in serverless because it's a lot of content to duplicate.
