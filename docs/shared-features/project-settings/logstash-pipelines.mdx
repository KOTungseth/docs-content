This content applies to: <DocBadge template="elasticsearch" /> <DocBadge template="observability" /> <DocBadge template="security" /> 

This topic should pull in rough content from the MDX equivalent of https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/master/logstash-centralized-pipeline-management.html
and possibly https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/master/configuring-centralized-pipelines.html (or point to these docs).
Pending migration of the Logstash docs to MDX.
