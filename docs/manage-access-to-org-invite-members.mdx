Anyone can be invited to join an organization, whether that person has an Elastic Cloud account or not. Organization owners can invite new users to the organization by using their email addresses. 

To invite a new member:

1. Go to the user icon on the header bar and select **Organization**.
2. Click **Invite members**. 

   You can add multiple members by entering their email addresses separated by a space.

   For each solution, you can grant access to one or more projects and assign roles to the users.

3. Click **Send invites**.

   Invitations to join an organization are sent by email. You have 72 hours to accept the invitation, after which it will expire. If you don’t get the invitation in the main inbox, check your spam folder.

On the **Members** tab of the **Organization** page, you can view the list of current members, their status and role.

In the **Actions** column, click the three dots edit a member’s role or revoke the invite.

## Leave an organization

On the **Organization** page, click **Leave organization**.

If you’re the only user in the organization, you can only leave if you deleted all your projects and you don't have pending bills.
