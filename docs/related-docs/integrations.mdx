Elastic integrations are a streamlined way to connect your data to Elastic.
Integrations are available for popular services and platforms, like Nginx, AWS, and MongoDB,
as well as many generic input types like log files.

Integration documentation is available in the product when you install an integration,
or you can explore our [Elastic integrations documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations).
