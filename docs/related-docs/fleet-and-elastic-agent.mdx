Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, 
metrics, and other types of data to a host. 
A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure.
Each agent has a single policy you can update to add integrations for new data sources.

Fleet provides a web-based UI to centrally manage your Elastic Agents and their policies.

For more information about using Fleet, refer to the [Fleet and Elastic Agent documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/index.html).
