An organization is the foundational construct under which everything is grouped and managed in Elastic Cloud. Every organization has a unique identifier, and customer accounts and bills are invoiced at the organization level. 

Elastic Cloud users are members of organizations. Every user can only be a member of a single organization and can be assigned to standard roles, which grant permissions to access either organization-level resources or deployment-level resources for deployments under their organization.
