<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
Projects can be managed using the Elastic Cloud REST API. This API allows you to create, update, and delete projects, as well as manage project features and usage.

## API Principles

- The Elastic Cloud REST API is built following REST principles:
  - Resources (such as projects) are represented as URIs.
  - Standard HTTP response codes and verbs are used (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE).
  - API calls are stateless. Every request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all the information necessary to fulfill the request.
- JSON is the data interchange format.

## Authentication

API Keys are used to authenticate requests to the Elastic Cloud REST API.
Learn how to create [API keys](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-api-authentication.html).

The API Key should be provided in all API requests in the `Authorization` header such as:
```bash
"Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY"
```

For example, if you interact with the API using the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey essu_..." https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch
```

## Open API Specification

The Project Management API is documented using the [OpenAPI specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification). The current supported version of the specification is `3.0`.

Here you can read the [API reference](https://docs.elastic.co/api-reference) or download the [OpenAPI specification](https://docs.elastic.co/api-reference/openapi/serverless-project-api.yml).

This specification can be used to generate client SDKs, or on tools that support it, such as the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io).


## Examples

In the following examples, for convenience, we will export the generated API key so that we can reuse it in every API request:

```bash
export API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY"
```

### Create a Serverless Elasticsearch Project

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch" \
     -XPOST --data '{
        "name": "{NAME}", [^1]
        "region_id": "aws-eu-west-1" [^2]
     }'
```
[^1]: Replace **`{NAME}`** with a more descriptive name in this call.
[^2]: You can <DocLink id="serverlessGeneralManageProjectRestAPI" text="obtain a list of available regions" section="list-available-regions" />

The response from the create project request will include the created project details, such as the project ID,
the credentials to access the project, and the endpoints to access different apps such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.

Example of Create Project response:
```json
{
    "id": "cace8e65457043698ed3d99da2f053f6",
    "endpoints": {
        "elasticsearch": "https://sample-project-c990cb.es.us-east-1.aws.staging.elastic.cloud",
        "kibana": "https://sample-project-c990cb-c990cb.kb.us-east-1.aws.staging.elastic.cloud"
    },
    "credentials": {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "abcd12345"
    }
    (...)
}
```

You may want to store the project id as an environment variable for the following requests:
```bash
export PROJECT_ID=cace8e65457043698ed3d99da2f053f6
```

### Get Project

At any time you can retrieve your project through an API call:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}"
```

#### Get project status

A 'status' endpoint indicates whether the project is initialized and ready for being used. The phase will change from "initializing" to "initialized" when the project is ready.:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}/status"
```

Example response:
```json
{
    {"phase":"initializing"}
}
```

### Reset Credentials

If you lose the credentials provided at the time of the project creation, you can reset the credentials by using the following endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    -XPOST \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}/_reset-credentials"
```

### Delete Project

You can delete your project via the API:

```bash
curl -XDELETE -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}"
```

### Update Project

You can update your project using PATCH semantics. Only those fields included in the body of the request will be updated.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}" \
    -XPATCH --data '{
        "name": "new name",
        "alias": "new-project-alias"
     }'
```

### List available regions

The list of regions where projects can be created can be obtained using the API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/regions"
```
