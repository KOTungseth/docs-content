When you buy ECU to pay for your {/* {book['n']} */} usage, they are contracted through a purchase order consisting of one or more order lines. Each order line has a number of attributes:

Credits 
    : The quantity of Elastic Consumption Units purchased through an order line and used to cover your consumption.

Usage 
    : Your {/* {book['n']} */} resource consumption quantified in ECU. Resources consumed include capacity (RAM-hours), data transfer (data inter-node and data out), and snapshot storage (storage size or snapshot API calls). These three consumption types are generally known as <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enCloudEcBillingDimensions">billing dimensions</DocLink> */}.

Remaining balance 
    : The quantity of ECU remaining on an order line. This is calculated as the original amount of credits purchased minus the credits used so far.

Start date 
    : The date when the credits belonging to an order line can begin to be used to offset your consumption.

Expiration date 
    : The date until which the purchased credits are valid and can be used to offset consumption. After this date, any unused credits are forfeited.

Status 
    : An order line can have one of the following statuses:

* Active: this means that the start date is in the past and the expiration date is in the future.
* Expired: The expiration date for the line item is before the current date.
* Future: The start date for the line item is after the current date.

List unit price 
    : The list price paid for one ECU, in the transacted currency. This price does not include any discounts.

Discount rate 
    : The discount percentage applied to the list unit price of one ECU.

Paid amount 
    : The currency cost of the purchased credits. This is calculated as **Credits x List unit price x (100 - Discount rate)/100**.
