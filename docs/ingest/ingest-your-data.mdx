You have options for ingesting, or indexing, data into Elasticsearch. 
You can use Elastic Agent integrations, Beats, Logstash, Elastic language clients, Elastic connectors, or the Enterprise Search web crawler. 
The best ingest option--or options--for your use case depends on whether you are indexing general content or time-series (timestamped) data.

<div id="ec-ingest-methods"></div>

**General content** 

General content includes HTML pages, catalogs, files, and other content that does not update continuously. 
This data can be updated, but the value of the content remains relatively constant over time.
You can send data directly to Elasticseach from your application using an Elastic language client. 
Otherwise use Elastic content [connectors](((enterprise-search-ref))/connectors.html) or the Elastic [web crawler](((enterprise-search-ref))/crawler.html).

**Times series (timestamped) data**

Time series, or timestamped data, describes data that changes frequently and "flows" over time, such as stock quotes, system metrics, and network traffic data.
Elastic Agent integrations are the preferred way to index time series data. 
If no Elastic Agent integration is available for your data source, use Beats to collect your data.
If no Beat is available for your data source, use Logstash to collect your data.
