((ls)) is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
It supports a wide variety of data sources, and can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. 

((ls)) can collect data using a variety of ((ls)) input plugins, enrich and transform the data if needed, and output it to ((serverless-full)) using the logstash-elasticsearch-output plugin.
Use ((ls)) to extend ((beats)) for advanced use cases such as data routed to multiple destinations or when you need to make your data persistent. 

Check out the [Logstash product page](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) for more info.
When you're ready, dive into the [Logstash documentation](((logstash-ref)/index.html.

((ls)) is a powerful, versatile ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) engine that can play an important role in organizations of all sizes.
Some capabilities and features for large, self-managed users aren't appropriate for the ((serverless-full)) offering.

You'll use the logstash-output-elasticsearch plugin to send data to ((serverless-full)). 
Some differences to note between Elastic Serverless and self-managed ((es)): 

- ((serverless-full)) uses **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)** instead of Index Lifecycle Management (ILM). If you add ILM settings to your elasticsearch output configuration, they are ignored and may cause errors.
- Your logstash-output-elasticsearch configuration uses **API keys** to access ((es)) from ((ls)). User-based security settings are ignored and may cause errors. 
- **((ls)) monitoring** for ((serverless-full)) is still under development.
