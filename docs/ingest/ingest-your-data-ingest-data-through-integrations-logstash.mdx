Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
It supports a wide variety of data sources, and can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. 
Logstash can enrich and transform data with a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins.
Many native codecs are available to further simplify the ingestion process. 

You can use Logstash to extend Elastic Agent or Beats for advanced use cases such as data routed to multiple destinations or when you need to make your data persistent. 

<DocCallOut id="ls-serverless-notes" title="Logstash for Elastic Serverless">

Logstash is a powerful, versatile ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) engine that can play an important role in organizations of all sizes.
Some capabilities and features for large, self-managed users aren't appropriate for the Elastic Serverless offering.

You'll use the logstash-output-elasticsearch plugin to send data to Elastic Serverless. 
Some differences to note between Elastic Serverless and self-managed Elasticsearch: 

- Elastic Serverless uses **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)** instead of Index Lifecycle Management (ILM). If you add ILM settings to your elasticsearch output configuration, they are ignored and may cause errors.
- Your logstash-output-elasticsearch configuration uses **API keys** to access Elasticsearch from Logstash. User-based security settings are ignored and may cause errors. 
- **Logstash monitoring** for Elastic Serverless is still under development.
