((beats)) are lightweight data shippers that send operational data to ((es)).
Elastic provides separate ((beats)) for different types of data, such as logs, metrics, and uptime.
Depending on what data you want to collect, you may need to install multiple shippers on a single host.

| Data | ((beats))|
|---|---|
| Audit data | [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/auditbeat) |
| Log files and journals | [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat)|
| Cloud data | [Functionbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/functionbeat)|
| Availability | [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/heartbeat)|
| Metrics | [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat)|
| Network traffic | [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat)|
| Windows event logs | [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/winlogbeat)|

((beats)) can send data to ((es)) directly or through ((ls)), where you
can further process and enhance the data before visualizing it in ((kib)).
