Elastic Agent integrations are the preferred way to index time series (timestamped) data. 
The Elastic Agent provides a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. 
It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, and forward data from remote services or hardware. 
Each Elastic Agent-based integration includes default ingestion rules, dashboards, and visualizations to help you start analyzing your data right away.

If no Elastic Agent integration is available for your data source, use Beats to collect your data.
If neither Elastic Agent nor Beats supports your data source, use Logstash.

If you're just learning about Elastic and don't have a particular use case in mind,
you can [load one of the sample data sets](((kibana-ref))/sample-data.html) in Kibana.
Complete with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more, they provide a quick way
to see what's possible with Elastic.
