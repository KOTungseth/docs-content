If different persons from your organization are involved in billing and operations, you can specify their relevant contact details in addition to the members set up on the account. 

These additional contacts only receive billing or operational emails. You can also set a specific email address to receive monitoring alerts. Members of the account still receive both types of emails. 

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Operational contacts can only receive operational notifications, such as out-of-memory alerts. Operational and billing contacts can't log in to ((es)) Serverless Console. To log in to the ((es)) Serverless Console, you must use the primary email address for your account or be a member of the account.

To update billing and operational contacts, or set an email address for monitoring alerts:

1. Log in Log in to the ((es)) Serverless Console.

1. Select the user icon on the header bar and choose **Organization** from the menu.

1. Under the **Contacts** tab, you can specify multiple email addresses for each category. They become effective immediately and no further confirmation of the email addresses is required.
