## Available features and limitations

Please note the following information about ((es)) on serverless. 

### Differences to Elastic Cloud and self-managed offerings

These changes are specific to ((es)) on serverless.

- Uses data streams and data lifecycle management (DLM) instead of index lifecycle management (ILM)
- APIs or settings related to sharding or replicas are not applicable, because these internals are fully managed
- Watcher is unavailable
