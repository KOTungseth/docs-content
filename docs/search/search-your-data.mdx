A search query, or query, is a request for information about data in ((es)) data streams or indices.

You can think of a query as a question, written in a way ((es)) understands. Depending on your data, you can use a query to get answers to questions like:

- What processes on my server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
- What users on my network ran regsvr32.exe within the last week?
- What pages on my website contain a specific word or phrase?

((es)) supports several search methods:

**Search for exact values**
Search for [exact values or ranges](((ref))/term-level-queries.html)  of numbers, dates, IPs, or strings.

**Full-text search**
Use [full text queries](((ref))/full-text-queries.html) to query [unstructured textual data](((ref))/analysis.html#analysis) and find documents that best match query terms.

**Vector search**
Store vectors in ((es)) and use [approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search](((ref))/knn-search.html) to find vectors that are similar, supporting use cases like [semantic search](((ref))/semantic-search.html).
