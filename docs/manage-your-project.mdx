To manage your project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/).

2. Log in to your Elastic Cloud account.

3. Select your project from the **Fully-managed projects** panel and click **Manage**.

From the project page, you can perform the following actions.

## Rename your project

In the **Overview** section, click **Edit** next to the project's name.

## Edit Search Power 

Search Power controls the number of VCUs (Virtual Compute Units) allocated per GB of data to your project. Each VCU adds a combination of CPU, RAM, and data storage to your project, resulting in performance gains.

We recommend running your typical search workload for 48-96 hours at the default Search Power setting of Balanced, and then adjust the setting based on search performance metrics if needed.

## Edit Search Data Lake

The Search Data Lake provides cost-optimized storage for your data.

By default, all data is stored indefinitely in the Search Data Lake and remains searchable. You can specify different retention periods for each data source configured in your project.

## Edit Search Boost Window

Search Boost provides accelerated query speed for frequently used data. Increasing the boost window results in improved search and analytics performance for more data in your Search Lake.

The default Search Boost window size is 7 days. To request an update to this default, contact [Support](https://support.elastic.co/).

## Delete your project

When you delete a project, you remove all the relevant data. 

1. From the **Actions** drop-down button on the top right corner, select **Delete project**.

2. To confirm, enter the name of the project to be removed and click **Delete**.
